<h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
<h2>Here's a little info about myself...</h2>
<hr />
<h3>My name:</h3>
<p>Michelle Murphy</p>
<p>
    <h3>My program:</h3> Computer Science Honours (Co-operative Education)<br/>
    <h3>Program year:</h3> Third Year 
</p>
<p><h3>About me:</h3>Hi there! I'm a motivated and hard-working <br/>
        computer science student and a budding software developer. 🌱👩🏻‍💻 🌱 <br/>

    My passion for solving problems brought me to Carleton University where <br/>
    I am halfway through my B.Sc. Honours in Computer Science. 💻<br/><br/>

    I am proud to be selected as one of the participants in the 2021 cohort of <br/>
    the AI4Good Lab, a program that helps to alter technology’s course towards <br/>
    social improvement. After the intensive 7-week course learning Artificial <br/>
    Intelligence techniques and building our Machine learning platform, Datallite 📊 📡 <br/>
    we won the Accelerator Award. With the support of the AI4Good Lab program and the award,<br/>
    my teammates and I are continuing to work on closing data gaps around the world. 🌎!<br/><br/>
</p>

<p>I have experience coding in C (v 17), Java (v 15), Python (v 3.7) and HTML (v 5)!  <br/>
    I'm always looking to advance my skills and after participating in the AI4Good Lab Program<br/>
    this summer, I gained experience with ML teachniques. This includes best practices of ML, <br/>
    Neural Networks, Convolutional Nerual Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning<br/>
    I'm also very interested in software development and was able to work in a group of other participants<br/>
    to create our very own AI platform implemented by using Python, Pytorch and React. <br/>
    

<p>I am a forever learner and I love new challenges that test my skills.</p>
